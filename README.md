Project Title: AI-Based Smart Water Monitoring & Reporting System

ðŸ“Œ Project Description
Water-related issues such as flooding, water pollution, drainage blockages, and pipe bursts are common in urban and rural areas. However, these problems often go unreported or take too long to be addressed due to a lack of an efficient reporting system.

This project, AI-Based Smart Water Monitoring & Reporting System, is a mobile application built using Flutter that allows users to report water-related issues in real-time. The app uses OpenStreetMap for location tracking, AI for image analysis, and a volunteer system to engage the community in water conservation and disaster response.

This system aims to:

âœ… Enable citizens to report water-related problems quickly

âœ… Help authorities respond to issues faster

âœ… Provide real-time air quality monitoring

âœ… Use AI for waste classification and environmental awareness

âœ… Encourage community participation through rewards and volunteering

The app is integrated with a Flask-based backend that processes reports, stores user data in a MySQL database, and provides real-time updates.
